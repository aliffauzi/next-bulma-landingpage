# jsdiff


A javascript text differencing implementation.

Based on the algorithm proposed in
["An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.4.6927).

## Installation

    npm install diff

or

    git clone git://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff.git

## API

* `JsDiff.diffChars(oldStr, newStr)` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing character by character.

    Returns a list of change objects (See below).

* `JsDiff.diffWords(oldStr, newStr)` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing word by word.

    Returns a list of change objects (See below).

* `JsDiff.diffLines(oldStr, newStr)` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing line by line.

    Returns a list of change objects (See below).

* `JsDiff.diffCss(oldStr, newStr)` - diffs two blocks of text, comparing CSS tokens.

    Returns a list of change objects (See below).

* `JsDiff.createPatch(fileName, oldStr, newStr, oldHeader, newHeader)` - creates a unified diff patch.

    Parameters:
    * `fileName` : String to be output in the filename sections of the patch
    * `oldStr` : Original string value
    * `newStr` : New string value
    * `oldHeader` : Additional information to include in the old file header
    * `newHeader` : Additional information to include in thew new file header

* `JsDiff.applyPatch(oldStr, diffStr)` - applies a unified diff patch.

    Return a string containing new version of provided data.

* `convertChangesToXML(changes)` - converts a list of changes to a serialized XML format

### Change Objects
Many of the methods above return change objects. These objects are consist of the following fields:

* `value`: Text content
* `added`: True if the value was inserted into the new string
* `removed`: True of the value was removed from the old string

Note that some cases may omit a particular flag field. Comparison on the flag fields should always be done in a truthy or falsy manner.

## Examples

Basic example in Node

```js
require('colors')
var jsdiff = require('diff');

var one = 'beep boop';
var other = 'beep boob blah';

var diff = jsdiff.diffChars(one, other);

diff.forEach(function(part){
  // green for additions, red for deletions
  // grey for common parts
  var color = part.added ? 'green' :
    part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey';
  process.stderr.write(part.value[color]);
});

console.log()
```
